// the stacks for the pipeline (`npx projen` generates one deploy job per stack from them).
const app = new CreApp();

// No stacks yet: the project's design decides what it deploys (a VPC, or none at all for a
// serverless design). Each top-level stack is a CreStack with the region the pipeline deploys it
// to, named from the project:
//
//   new MyStack(app, app.stackId(), { region: 'us-east-2' });          // `$PROJECT_NAME`
//   new CreDashboardStack(app, app.stackId('dashboard'), { region: 'us-east-2' });
//
// Guide: .kiro/steering/cre-pipelines.md. Until a stack exists, the build is green and the deploy
// stage uploads nothing.
