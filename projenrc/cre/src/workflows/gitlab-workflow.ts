/**
 * Wires the GitLab pipeline onto the project. Every job runs a projen task (the one exception,
 * build:docker on the node-less kaniko image, runs the script behind the build:docker task).
 *
 * Stages:
 *   build  — runs on MRs + main:
 *     build:cdk      `yarn ci:build:cdk` — cdk synth, the stack-wiring and stack-plan checks, lint,
 *                    unit tests, CFN asset staging (node image). Artifacts: assets/, cdk.out/.
 *     build:container-plan, build:docker  (containerImages only) — list the images, build each
 *                    with kaniko into assets/containers/.
 *     build:package  `yarn ci:build:package` — zip assets/ → dist/content.zip.
 *
 *   deploy — runs on the default branch only (split-trust analog: gated to main).
 *            The gate is only as strong as the variable: AWS_CREDS_TARGET_ROLE MUST be a
 *            **Protected** CI/CD variable and `main` a protected branch. The credential
 *            vendor runs as a pre_clone script for EVERY job that can see the variable, so
 *            an unprotected one hands the deploy role to every MR pipeline — i.e. to MR
 *            code (yarn install, tests, or an MR that edits .gitlab-ci.yml).
 *     deploy:upload  `npx projen deploy:upload` — publish templates, assets (and images) to every
 *                    listed region's bucket.
 *     deploy:<stack> one job per stack, named after it (`deploy:<project>-edge`), `npx projen
 *                    deploy:stack`, with the variables stack-jobs.ts generates for it. `needs`:
 *                    deploy:upload plus the jobs of the stacks it takes outputs from (and its
 *                    `dependsOn`); their dist/<stack>.env dotenv artifacts carry the outputs.
 *     deploy:prune   `npx projen deploy:prune`, after every stack job.
 *
 * AWS credentials are minted by the GitLab runner wrapper from the project-level
 * `AWS_CREDS_TARGET_ROLE` CI/CD variable (kept out of the repo), the same role in every job; a
 * stack in another account assumes its `assumeRole` from it (role chaining in deploy-stack.py).
 * `AWS_REGION` is the stack's region in each stack job (the CLI v2 reads it). Every deploy job also
 * sets `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to the same region: gitlab.aws.dev's AWS Credential Vendor mints
 * credentials only for a job that sets both `AWS_CREDS_TARGET_ROLE` and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
 * (BuilderHub, "Vending AWS credentials to CI/CD jobs"); a job without it gets none, and every AWS
 * call fails "Unable to locate credentials" (seen live when it was removed). GitHub's credentials
 * come from aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials, which needs neither.
 *
 * Operators set these CI/CD variables in GitLab project settings:
 *   AWS_CREDS_TARGET_ROLE   IAM role ARN the runner wrapper assumes for AWS calls.
 *                           Protected: yes (see the deploy stage note above).
 *   Every variable the stacks name (CreCfnParameter fromVariable, assumeRole, executionRole;
 *   CFN_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN by default). GitLab passes project CI/CD variables to every job, so
 *   each stack job references the ones it uses, and fails fast on a required one that's empty.
 *   cre-stacks.json's `environment` lists them.
 *
 * AWS_REGION is NOT in that list: it comes from `opts.awsRegion`, which the recipe
 * substitutes from the target region the builder gave at STEP 1. It is deliberately
 * REQUIRED (no default) — an `?? 'us-east-1'` fallback is what previously caused a
 * demo requested in us-east-2 to deploy to us-east-1 silently, and a compile error
 * beats a wrong region. A CI/CD variable of the same name still overrides it.
