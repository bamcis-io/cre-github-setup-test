/**
 * The GitHub deploy workflow: the per-stack deploy jobs, run after a PR merges to main.
 *
 * The PR flow is projen's (as in multi-az-workshop): `npx projen push` opens the PR with the
 * `auto-approve` and `auto-merge` labels; projen's auto-approve workflow approves a trusted
 * author's labelled PR and its auto-queue workflow enables auto-merge (squash). Branch protection
 * on main requires the `build` check and an approval, so the PR merges only once the build passed.
 * The merge is a push to main, which runs this workflow. That is the same model as GitLab: main
 * takes no direct pushes, and every change deploys when its MR/PR merges.
 *
 * Triggers:
 *  - push to main: the merged PR (merged by projen's auto-merge with the builder's GitHub App token, not GITHUB_TOKEN, so it triggers this);
 *  - workflow_dispatch: redeploy main by hand.
 *
 * Jobs: `build` (checks out the exact commit, `npx projen build`, uploads dist/content.zip),
 * `deploy-upload`, one job per stack (stack-jobs.ts, the same needs and variables as the GitLab
 * pipeline and the local deploy) and `deploy-prune`. Only code that is on main runs with
 * AWS_CREDS_TARGET_ROLE, and the runner role trusts only main's OIDC subject (setup); in a public
 * repo, only the `AWS` environment's, which only the deploy jobs declare and only main may use.
 *
 * Concurrency: one deploy run at a time per repository (the workflow's `concurrency` group,
 * cancel-in-progress off), so two merges never update one stack at once and a running deploy is
 * never cancelled mid-CloudFormation. A run still waiting when a newer merge arrives is cancelled
 * by GitHub, and the newer run deploys both (watch follows it: review 10d F3). GitLab serialises
 * per stack job instead (`resource_group`).
