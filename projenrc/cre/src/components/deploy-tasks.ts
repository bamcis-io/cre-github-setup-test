 *   deploy:stack   deploy one stack with the variables its job sets (scripts/build/deploy-stack.py)
 *   deploy:prune   remove old asset prefixes (keeps the current one and two before it)
 *

 * deploy:stack once per stack in deploy order with exactly its CI job's variables (outputs from the
 * dotenv files the stacks it needs wrote), then deploy:prune. Never CloudFormation exports, never
