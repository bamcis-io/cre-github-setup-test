/**
 * Provider-AGNOSTIC build lifecycle for the green CRE demo skeleton.
 *
 * Part of the cre-projen package (vendored into each demo at projenrc/cre/), called by
 * CreDemoTemplateApp for both providers. CI in both families only ever invokes
 * the projen tasks registered here (`npx projen <task>`) — this is the PROJEN_PATTERN
 * "CI ↔ task parity" principle that keeps the GitHub/GitLab seam narrow.
 *
 * The lifecycle:
 *
 *   preCompileTask   → wipe assets/ + cdk.out/ so downstream phases start clean
 *   compileTask      → tsc (projen-native, unchanged)
 *   postCompileTask  → `synth:silent` (cdk synth), check:stack-wiring, check:stack-plan, then
 *                      with containerImages build:container-plan + build:docker
 *   testTask         → jest + eslint (projen-native, unchanged)
 *   packageTask      → stage CFN assets (package:assets) → zip into dist/content.zip
 *
 * Result: one `yarn build` (or `npx projen build`) produces `dist/content.zip`
 * carrying the CFN template + staged file assets the deploy mechanism consumes.
 *
 * The container tasks exist only with `containerImages`: without a DockerImageAsset in the app
 * there is nothing for them to build.

/**
 * Options for {@link createBuildTasks}.
 *
 * `containerImages` is the single toggle gating the container-build
 * lifecycle. When false (the green skeleton default), NO docker tasks are registered
 * and NO docker steps attach to postCompile — the skeleton emits zero container work
 * and stays green with zero edits (NFR1). The provider workflow factories receive the
 * SAME flag so CI jobs and lifecycle tasks light up together — never one without the
 * other (the failure mode where a job is emitted with no asset, or vice-versa).
 *
 * Both providers build images the same way: `build:container-plan` + `build:docker` run in
 * postCompile and write `assets/containers/<hash>.tar.gz` (`docker build` on GitHub runners and
 * laptops; the GitLab build:docker job runs kaniko-build.sh instead, as its runners allow no Docker
 * daemon), and
 * `deploy:docker` pushes them with crane. See workflows/container-tools.ts.
