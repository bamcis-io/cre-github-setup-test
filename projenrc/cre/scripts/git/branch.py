"""npx projen branch <name>          (or --branch <name>)

Start new work: fetch, create <name> from origin/<default> and bring along the uncommitted changes
(plus unpushed commits made on the default branch, or commits made after a branch merged), then
reset the local default branch to origin's when you were on it. From a detached HEAD the branch
starts at HEAD instead, so its commits stay. On conflict nothing changes and it exits 30.
