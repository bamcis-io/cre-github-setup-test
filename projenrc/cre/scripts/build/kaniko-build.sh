#!/usr/bin/env sh
#
# The GitLab build:docker job: build every DockerImageAsset listed in dist/container-plan.tsv with
# kaniko and save each one to assets/containers/<hash>.tar.gz.
#
# Kaniko is used here instead of `docker build` because the shared GitLab runner fleet doesn't
# allow Docker-in-Docker and blocks the CLONE_NEWUSER syscall that rootless podman/buildah need.
# Kaniko builds OCI images in a chroot — no daemon, no user namespaces. Everywhere else (GitHub
# runners, laptops) `build:docker` runs build-docker.py, a plain `docker build`.
#
# Written for the kaniko `:debug` image, which is distroless + busybox — so no python, no apk, no
# bash. Everything here is POSIX sh + busybox coreutils. The JSON work (enumerating CDK assets,
# writing manifest.json) is container-plan.py's, on the node image, which writes the plain-text
# plan this reads.
#
# Optional env:
#   KANIKO_EXECUTOR      Defaults to /kaniko/executor (the job image's).
#   CONTAINER_PLAN_FILE  Defaults to dist/container-plan.tsv.
#   CONTAINERS_DIR       Defaults to assets/containers.
#   CONTAINER_CACHE_DIR  Persistent content-addressed tarball cache. Defaults to dist/.cache/containers.
#
# CACHING: CDK image hashes are content hashes of the build context, so an existing <hash>.tar.gz is
# what a rebuild would produce. On a cache hit the tarball is reused and kaniko is skipped — no
# base-image pull (so no public.ecr.aws rate-limit hit) and no recompile. The build:docker job's
# GitLab `cache:` block persists dist/.cache/containers across pipelines (keyed per branch).
