"""synth:silent — `cdk synth -q`, accepting an app with no stacks.

The CDK CLI exits 1 with "This app contains no stacks" for an app that synthesizes none, after the
app ran and wrote cdk.out (manifest.json, and CreApp's cre-stacks.json). A fresh scaffold has no
stacks on purpose (the project's design adds them), so that one case is a success here; every other
failure is passed through with its output and exit code. Arguments go on to cdk.
