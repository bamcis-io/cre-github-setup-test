"""Delete old deploy prefixes from the assets buckets, keeping the current deploy plus the two
before it. Runs as the last deploy phase, only after every stack deployed.

  PROJECT_NAME   prefixes live under s3://<bucket>/<PROJECT_NAME>/
  ASSETS_PREFIX  this deploy's prefix (always kept)
  PRUNE_REGIONS  space-separated regions; each one's bucket is named from PROJECT_NAME and the
                 account the credentials are for (assets.py)
  PRUNE_KEEP     previous prefixes to keep besides the current one (default 2)

A prefix is a deploy prefix only if its name is a run id (`<project>/<digits>/`: GitLab's pipeline
id, GitHub's run id) or a UTC timestamp (`<project>/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ/`, a local deploy).
Anything else under the project, and anything outside it, is never touched. Prefixes are ordered by
their newest object's LastModified, because the two naming schemes don't sort against each other.

Only prefixes OLDER than this deploy's are candidates: on GitLab another pipeline may have uploaded
a newer prefix and still be waiting for its stacks' resource groups, and deleting it would fail its
deploys (review 10b D2). The current one's age is its newest object's.

Never fails the deploy: problems are reported as warnings and the script exits 0. The stacks are
already deployed by the time this runs, and the worst case of not pruning is a larger bucket.
